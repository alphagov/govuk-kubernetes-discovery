# Architecture

## Architecture Decision Records

Record design decisions for the architecture so we know the context of our
choices.

Use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to help manage the decisions.

`brew install adr-tools`

`adr new "Some subject we decided on"`

Check the [blog by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
